## Repository Preparation Clarification

Even if no application code has been committed yet, cloning the repository early is useful because it lets us:

1. Verify our local credentials and access rights to the remote before we start coding.
2. Establish the exact directory structure and baseline configuration that later steps will build upon.
3. Track every incremental change with version control so the step-by-step workflow stays consistent.

By setting up the repo first we avoid access surprises later and keep the project history clean once we begin implementing the planned milestones.
